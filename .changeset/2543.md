Add Azure DevOps support to the scaffolder backend

This adds support for Azure DevOps to the scaffolder (preparer & publisher). I thought I should get this in there now since #2426 has been merged. I had a previous PR with only the preparer but I closed that in favor of this one.

I stayed with the 'azure/api' structure but I guess we should try and go the same way as with GitHub here #2501
