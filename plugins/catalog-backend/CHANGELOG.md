# @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend

## 0.1.1
### Patch Changes

- e0be86b6f: Entirely case insensitive read path of entities
- 12b5fe940: Add ApiDefinitionAtLocationProcessor that allows to load a API definition from another location
- 3472c8be7: Add codeowners processor
  
  - Add `codeowners-utils@^1.0.2` as a dependency
  - Add `core-js@^3.6.5` as a dependency
  - Added new CodeOwnersProcessor
- 57d555eb2: This feature works the same as \$secret does in config - it allows programmatic substitution of values into a document.
  
  This is particularly useful e.g. for API type entities where you do not want to repeat your entire API spec document inside the catalog-info.yaml file. For those cases, you can instead do something like
  
  ```
  apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
  kind: API
  metadata:
    name: my-federated-service
  spec:
    type: graphql
    definition:
      $text: ./schema.graphql
  ```
  
  The textual content of that file will be injected as the value of definition, during each refresh loop. Both relative and absolute paths are supported, as well as any HTTP/HTTPS URL pointing to a service that returns the relevant data.
  
  The initial version supports injection of text file data, and structured data from JSON and YAML files. You can add any handler of your own in addition to these.
- 61db1ddc6: Allow node v14 and add to master build matrix
  
  - Upgrade sqlite3@^5.0.0 in @backstage/plugin-catalog-backend
  - Add Node 14 to engines in @backstage/create-app
- 81cb94379: Simplify the read function in processors
- a768a07fb: Add the ability to import users from GitHub Organization into the catalog.
  
  The token needs to have the scopes `user:email`, `read:user`, and `read:org`.
